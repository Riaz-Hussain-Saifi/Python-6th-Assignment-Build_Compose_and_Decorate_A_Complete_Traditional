# Python OOP Assignments: Build, Compose, and Decorate

This repository contains solutions to 21 Python Object-Oriented Programming assignments that demonstrate core OOP concepts including class creation, inheritance, composition, decorators, and more.

## Repository Overview

This project is a comprehensive implementation of traditional Object-Oriented Programming concepts in Python. It serves as both a learning resource and a reference for Python developers who want to understand OOP principles through practical examples.

## Assignments Overview

This repository covers the following 21 OOP concepts:

1. **Using `self`** - Understanding instance attributes and methods
2. **Using `cls`** - Working with class methods and variables
3. **Public Variables and Methods** - Basic class accessibility
4. **Class Variables and Class Methods** - Shared state across instances
5. **Static Variables and Static Methods** - Utility functions within classes
6. **Constructors and Destructors** - Object lifecycle management
7. **Access Modifiers** - Public, protected, and private attributes
8. **The `super()` Function** - Parent class method access
9. **Abstract Classes and Methods** - Interface definition with ABC
10. **Instance Methods** - Working with object-specific functions
11. **Class Methods** - Operating on class-level data
12. **Static Methods** - Standalone utility functions
13. **Composition** - Building complex objects from other objects
14. **Aggregation** - Establishing "has-a" relationships
15. **Method Resolution Order (MRO)** - Understanding multiple inheritance
16. **Function Decorators** - Extending function behavior
17. **Class Decorators** - Enhancing class functionality
18. **Property Decorators** - Implementing getters, setters and deleters
19. **`callable()` and `__call__()`** - Making objects callable like functions
20. **Custom Exceptions** - Creating specialized error types
21. **Custom Iterables** - Making objects work with Python's iteration protocol

## How to Use This Repository

Each concept is implemented in its own Python file in the `assignments` directory. To run any example:

```bash
python assignments/01_using_self.py
```

Feel free to modify and experiment with the code to deepen your understanding of each concept.
