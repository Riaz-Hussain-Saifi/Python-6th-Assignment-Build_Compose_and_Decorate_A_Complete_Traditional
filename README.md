# Python OOP Assignments: Build, Compose, and Decorate

This repository contains solutions to 21 Python Object-Oriented Programming assignments that demonstrate core OOP concepts including class creation, inheritance, composition, decorators, and more.

## Repository Overview

This project is a comprehensive implementation of traditional Object-Oriented Programming concepts in Python. It serves as both a learning resource and a reference for Python developers who want to understand OOP principles through practical examples.

## Assignments Overview

This repository covers the following 21 OOP concepts:

1. **[Using `self`](https://github.com/Riaz-Hussain-Saifi/Python-6th-Assignment-Build_Compose_and_Decorate_A_Complete_Traditional/tree/main/assignments_01_to_21/01_using_self.py)** - Understanding instance attributes and methods
2. **[Using `cls`](https://github.com/Riaz-Hussain-Saifi/Python-6th-Assignment-Build_Compose_and_Decorate_A_Complete_Traditional/tree/main/assignments_01_to_21/02_using_cls.py)** - Working with class methods and variables
3. **[Public Variables and Methods](https://github.com/Riaz-Hussain-Saifi/Python-6th-Assignment-Build_Compose_and_Decorate_A_Complete_Traditional/tree/main/assignments_01_to_21/03_public_variables.py)** - Basic class accessibility
4. **[Class Variables and Class Methods](https://github.com/Riaz-Hussain-Saifi/Python-6th-Assignment-Build_Compose_and_Decorate_A_Complete_Traditional/tree/main/assignments_01_to_21/04_class_variables.py)** - Shared state across instances
5. **[Static Variables and Static Methods](https://github.com/Riaz-Hussain-Saifi/Python-6th-Assignment-Build_Compose_and_Decorate_A_Complete_Traditional/tree/main/assignments_01_to_21/05_static_methods.py)** - Utility functions within classes

8. **[The `super()` Function](https://github.com/Riaz-Hussain-Saifi/Python-6th-Assignment-Build_Compose_and_Decorate_A_Complete_Traditional/tree/main/assignments_01_to_21/08_super_function.py)** - Parent class method access
9. **[Abstract Classes and Methods](https://github.com/Riaz-Hussain-Saifi/Python-6th-Assignment-Build_Compose_and_Decorate_A_Complete_Traditional/tree/main/assignments_01_to_21/09_abstract_classes.py)** - Interface definition with ABC
